NeedKofea's Dotfiles.

The dotfiles are organised into `ki` modules. They can be installed using `ki`.

Get `ki` from `https://gitlab.com/needkofea/ki.git`

> [!WARNING]
> `ki` is pre-release software that is actively being working on.
> There is no guarantee that it will not break your system or even work at all!

If you are look for the old dotfiles, switch to `main` branch.

## TODO
1. Each individual script under desktop should be its own module.
2. Fully migrate old dotfile configuration into modules.
